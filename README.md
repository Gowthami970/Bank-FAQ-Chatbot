# Bank FAQ Chatbot

A simple AI-powered chatbot built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn** that answers banking-related questions. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on a dataset of frequently asked questions to predict the most relevant answer based on user input.

## Features

- Trained on a custom banking FAQ dataset (`BankFAQs.csv`)
- Uses `CountVectorizer` and `SVM` for text classification
- Matches user queries to the most similar question and provides an accurate answer
- Interactive and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit

### Dataset
The chatbot is trained on BankFAQs.csv, which contains banking-related questions, their categories (classes), and answers.

### How it works
1.User enters a banking question.
2.The question is transformed into a vector using CountVectorizer.
3.The SVM model predicts the questionâ€™s class.
4.The app finds the most similar question in the predicted class and displays the corresponding answer.

### Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
Pandas
Scikit-learn (SVM, CountVectorizer)
